# CodeForcesProblems

Repository for CodeForces Problems done by Swarup

All problems are solved by Swarup


## Problemset directory

All directories are Top-Level and named after their problemset.

### Problemset file
Each problemset directory has a markdown with the number of the problemset,
Such problemset file also contains details about each problem and example or potential inputs.

### Problem file

Each problemset directory has potentially multiple files named as the probems.
All problems must be in C files.

## Input

Input must somehow be redirected from a top=level .input file.

## Output

Output may be somehow redirected to potentially multiple files.
However, the main output must be sent to stdout.

## Test

The test directory includes C files that are used for testing and safekeeping purposes.

## Licence

MIT Licence


## Compilation

Each file is completely self-sufficient except for the use of libc packages. 

Therefore, there is no need for build systems such as makefiles. 

However, programs should be compiled in `gcc` with no additional flags.

There is no strict limit in the compilation target.

## Running

If a certain executable is runnable in a certain system, then it is okay to run.
